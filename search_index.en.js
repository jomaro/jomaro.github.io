The main goal is to\nprovide visibility to processes such as payments, refunds,\nchargebacks, etc.\nWe've been working on this system, which basically is an ETL in\nElixir that takes information from our transactional database and\nconverts it into financial and accounting events, persisting them\non an accounting database (more like the accounting book format.)\nFor example, for a payment requested and confirmed on our\ntransactional table payment, two accounting entries (credit and\ndebit) will be required, and we identify those with a\nPAYMENT_CONFIRMED|PAYMENT_RECOGNITION event on our accounting\ndatabase.\nThe amount of data to be processed with this pipeline can be\nHUGE. We sometimes have import tasks involving dozens of millions\nof ids that request data from over twenty database tables to\naccommodate all variations of product peculiarities. It's not\nrare to have jobs lasting something about 6 to 8 hours in a 36\ncores machine.\nThen at some point we decided the pipeline internals was to\ncomplicated and inaccessible for most part of the team that were\nnot really Elixir experts (darn macros).\nI then came forth with a new version and started implementing it\nand replacing the old pipeline. Also had to wanted to substitute\nthe code for the importing job to work better with the new code.\nIn the exact day we have all components placed and tests passing\nwith the new code comes the news: the project scope has changed,\nit needed to analyze a new period of time and we needed all the\nnew data imported before we could even start working.\nNot really how I had planned to test the new code, but it had to\nbe done and there was not really an easy way to put the old\npipeline working again (my bad).\nIt's ok, no pressure.\nSo I put the new ids file to import and the time metrics says the\nprocessing would be finished in days, not hours. It would be a\nbig blunder if I had done all that work and in the end have to\nrevert everything for not having given though on the performance.\nOh, of course, I just forgot something...\n\"Let's make it parallel\", I said, \"we've done it before\". Yeah,\nif just the elixir runtime would agree with me.\nThe problem was not so simple, we had a previous version of the\nsame importing pipeline which we used to run on Flow but we would\nlike to try something simpler like\nTask.async_stream.\nWe had the new sub-pipeline that would do all of the important\nwork. In the importing pipeline (that will be my main subject\nhere) we just had to feed it with chunks of ids and stream the\nresults to the Database component.\nThe internal pipeline was already complex enough so it was not a\nvery good candidate for parallelism and we didn't want to\ncomplicate our logic there.\nSo an easy way out is to parallelize the calls to the internal\npipeline on the importing job pipeline that will also persist the\ninformation on the database.\nHere is some draft code for you to have a taste:\ndefmodule MyProj.FileImporterJob do\n  alias MyProj.Database\n  alias MyProj.EventGeneratorPipeline\n  @load_chunk_size 50\n  @insert_chunk_size 3\n  @load_workers 8\n\n  @insert_workers 4\n  def execute_pipeline(ids_file_path) do\n    ids_file_path\n    |&gt; File.stream!(read_ahead: 65536)\n    |&gt; Stream.map(&amp;String.trim/1)\n    |&gt; Stream.map(&amp;String.to_integer/1)\n    |&gt; Stream.chunk_every(@load_chunk_size)\n    |&gt; Task.async_stream(&amp;EventGeneratorPipeline.execute/1, max_concurrency: @load_workers)\n    |&gt; Stream.flat_map(&amp;ensure_and_forward_stream/1)\n    |&gt; Stream.chunk_every(@insert_chunk_size)\n    |&gt; Task.async_stream(&amp;Database.insert/1, max_concurrency: @insert_workers)\n    |&gt; Stream.map(&amp;ensure_and_forward_stream/1)\n    |&gt; Stream.run\n  end\n  defp ensure_and_forward_stream({:ok, stream}), do: stream\nend\n\nVersion 1 of the new FileImporterJob using the new module EventGeneratorPipeline\nThe code was easy to read and all constraints I wanted to put on\nit were perfectly clear: how many records would I get from the\ndatabase per query, how many concurrent database connections, etc.\nSo, I get to run this code and the time expectation is absurdly\nbigger than it should be. A htop reveals to me that only 1 of our\n36 available cores was effectively doing some work. To complete\nthe situation, even that one core I had working would from time\nto time drop to almost zero.\nWhat has gone wrong?\nWe tried a lot of hypotheses, I remember looking for the queue\nsize of an internal genserver\nto see if that was the bottleneck.\nBut it wasn't.\nDesperation mode: on.\nI put a :read_ahead option on the File.stream trying to make a\nbetter use of my disk and there was some improvement. Mainly the\nproblem regarding drops in the processing became less frequent\nand less severe, but this surely was not my only bottleneck.\nAt some point, trying a lot of different things, I removed the\ncode between the two parallel parts, and BOOM: things started\nworking the way they were supposed to. Or at least, I got a\nsteady 65%~80% usage on all cores (which I trust is good enough\nfor a system that depends heavily on the database on the two ends.\n) In the end, the parallelism problem was a little sequential\nline of code throttling the whole pipeline. And that was not\nobvious, unfortunately.\ndefmodule MyProj.FileImporterJob do\n  alias MyProj.Database\n  alias MyProj.EventGeneratorPipeline\n  @load_chunk_size 50\n  @insert_chunk_size 3\n  @load_workers 8\n\n  @insert_workers 4\n  def execute_pipeline(ids_file_path) do\n    ids_file_path\n    |&gt; File.stream!(read_ahead: 65536)\n    |&gt; Stream.map(&amp;String.trim/1)\n    |&gt; Stream.map(&amp;String.to_integer/1)\n    |&gt; Stream.chunk_every(@load_chunk_size)\n    |&gt; Task.async_stream(&amp;EventGeneratorPipeline.execute/1, max_concurrency: @load_workers)\n    |&gt; Task.async_stream(&amp;Database.insert(&amp;1, insert_chunk_size: @insert_chunk_size), max_concurrency: @insert_workers)\n    |&gt; Stream.map(&amp;ensure_and_forward_stream/1)\n    |&gt; Stream.run\n  end\n  defp ensure_and_forward_stream({:ok, stream}), do: stream\nend\n\nThis also made me realize something important. The code was not\nexecuting the way I thought it would. In fact, seeing from a low\nlevel perspective, all a method of the Stream module does is to\ndefine a function, and this is not executed until someone (the\nnext piped function) calls that hidden function asking for a new\nvalue. So the flow is not given by the first line pushing data\ndownwards, but by the last line asking up for the next value and\ncascading up this call. That means that unlike what I thought\ninitially, it was not the first parallel part that was not being\nable to pass down the values in the speed it wanted. The truth\nwas that it was not receiving work to do since the throttle below\nwas not calling it frequently enough.\nThat was a hard realization to have, the data flow is surely\ntop-down, but in some sense the execution flow is bottom-up and\nthen top-down. Requests go up before the data can come down, and\nthe requests might get throttled somewhere before the data even\nhas a chance to walk down the pipeline.\nAnd overall it makes sense, that flatten was a sequential\noperation after all and removing it should improve the data flow\nfrom one step to the other since a parallel step would be capable\nof inducing more demand from its previous step.\ndefmodule MyProj.FileImporterJob do\n  alias MyProj.Database\n  alias MyProj.EventGeneratorPipeline\n\n  @load_chunk_size 50\n  @insert_chunk_size 3\n  @load_workers 8\n  @insert_workers 4\n\n  def execute_pipeline(ids_file_path) do\n    # we also decided to get all values to memory up-front\n    # and avoid the disk would mess our performance visibility\n    specs =\n      ids_file_path\n      |&gt; File.stream!(read_ahead: 65536)\n      |&gt; Stream.map(&amp;String.trim/1)\n      |&gt; Stream.map(&amp;String.to_integer/1)\n      |&gt; Enum.chunk_every(@load_chunk_size)\n\n    specs\n    |&gt; Task.async_stream(&amp;EventGeneratorPipeline.execute/1, max_concurrency: @load_workers)\n    |&gt; Task.async_stream(&amp;Database.insert(&amp;1, insert_chunk_size: @insert_chunk_size), max_concurrency: @insert_workers)\n    |&gt; Stream.run\n  end\nend\n\nThere is one final problem with this approach: inter process\ncommunication.\nThe big data chunks in this whole process are actually generated\nin the module EventGeneratorPipeline that runs inside the\nprocesses Task.async_stream spawns, but they are consumed in the\nother parallel part of the code, in another context. Which means,\nas far as I know, that they will be copied in memory to be passed\nto these others processes. And this copy could be avoided if we\nput producer and consumer to run in the same context:\ndefmodule MyProj.FileImporterJob do\n  alias MyProj.Database\n  alias MyProj.EventGeneratorPipeline\n\n  @load_chunk_size 50\n  @insert_chunk_size 3\n  @workers 8\n\n  def execute_pipeline(ids_file_path) do\n    specs =\n      ids_file_path\n      |&gt; File.stream!(read_ahead: 65536)\n      |&gt; Stream.map(&amp;String.trim/1)\n      |&gt; Stream.map(&amp;String.to_integer/1)\n      |&gt; Enum.chunk_every(@load_chunk_size)\n\n    specs\n    |&gt; Task.async_stream(&amp;process_chunk/1, max_concurrency: @workers)\n    |&gt; Stream.run\n  end\n  def process_chunk(chunk) do\n    chunk\n    |&gt; EventGeneratorPipeline.execute\n    |&gt; Database.insert(insert_chunk_size: @insert_chunk_size)\n  end\nend\n\nThis had a massive improvement in performance. The execution time\nof the whole job for a 1 million ids dropped from ~30 minutes to\n~15 minutes, roughly 50% improvement. I really regret not having\ndone this earlier.\nBut it didn't come without a cost to the code. Previously I had\nthe impression that it could both be loading data from the source\ndatabase, and inserting at my final database in an independent\nfashion. In a way I could keep data flowing in and out at the\nmaximum possible speed for each one.\nBut that is not possible anymore using the new version, although\nif I just let this run for enough time I think the threads would\neventually end up coordinating themselves, while some of them are\nfetching data some others would be storing.\nThis last version of the pipeline was a trade-off. To get less\nmemory copy I lost a whole bunch of control on my code. You may\nsee in this last example that we only have a workers variable, no\nmore load_workers and insert_workers. So I no longer have fine\ncontrol on how many workers I have using each database at any\ngiven time, just a general number of workers that may be\ndistributing well the workload or may be hitting the same\ndatabase all at once causing usage spikes.\nBut my overall performance went up, so I think this was a small\nprice to pay.\nConclusions\nElixir has been a wonderful language to work with. It was not my\nfirst language when I started in this project, but it has surely\nwon a lot of my appreciation since then. But I still learn a lot\nabout the language every time something comes up and wanted to\nshare this story for the one's who will try to do something\nparallel in elixir.\nSome things where really great, like how parallel and non\nparallel code can interact in elixir without losing that nice\nchain of pipes look. Somethings ended up not so great when things\ndidn't actually worked so well as I had imagined.\nIf I were to summarize in one thing to take from this post, most\nof the mistakes were about relying on elixir's nice syntax and\neasy of use without really given thought to what where the hard\nscience concepts behind that commands.\nLike the Inter-Process-Communication situation. I didn't thought\nat first that getting data in and out that function would require\nme a overhead so big as copying everything.\nOr the \"stream is just a function declaration\" thing, that got\nme off guard. At some point I had 40 workers calling the internal\npipeline, but that is made of streams internally, I was also not\ncalling anything to materialize those results in that context. So\nwhat I most probably had was 40 workers defining functions\nwithout really doing any work.\nAlso, something I took from this episode is: even in a language\nso nice as elixir I still had to sacrifice usability and\nreadability for performance.\nThat's all folks.\nIf anything is amiss or not accurate let me know. Although this\nsituation is good enough for all we use, it would be nice to\nrevisit this subject and improve upon it.\n","id":"https://jomaro.github.io/blog/a-parallel-quest-in-elixir/","title":"A parallel quest in elixir"},"https://jomaro.github.io/blog/minimal-code-pipelines-at-ebanx/":{"body":"EBANX, as a fast growing company, faces a lot of challenges. \nSome of them are related to that old balance on how much \nwe will take from the outside and how much of our problems \nwill be solved by in house products.\nRecently we had a new demand coming to the IT team about \nhow we manage some of our compliance flows. \nThe responsible team decided we should have an in house \nalternative (or extension) to some service providers.\nAnd that can actually be quite a task.\nAt EBANX we strive to deliver services that will allow \npeople access to services that are not immediately available \nto the general population for several reasons, most of them \nderiving from an in development economy and low banking maturity. \nSome of the services include: integration to common ecommerce \nplatforms, a refunds platform, a prepaid credit card, \npayment processing for companies and individuals from Brazil \nand outside that want to painlessly offer services or products \nin the Latim America market, and the list goes a little bit longer.\nBut let’s go back to that compliance demand. \nThis is a challenge in several different ways, starting from \nthe structure of the team. EBANX is made of some major areas \nand if we want to integrate products of them all we will need \ncollaboration and developer time from all of them. There is no \nhelping it. These developers would also probably not be the \nnewest ones, we would need experienced people to make some \nintegrations. More often than not, this precious workforce \ncannot be redirected from their home responsibilities. \nAnd surely, as the main team behind the project we will \nhave to live with some rotation of these developers. \nAgain, there is no helping it.\nEven if they were to be with us for a longer period of time \nthey would end up distancing themselves from their home projects, \nlosing their close knowledge of how things work there, \nand by consequence losing that precious value they have for us.\nSurprisingly, this factor that is not a technical one is \none of the big reasons behind our system architecture.\nSome of our technical requisites are:\n\nBeing able to integrate all of EBANX’s products, coming \nfrom all the different areas, and more to come\nBeing able to integrate several external providers, and more to come\nWork with the above mentioned personal situation\nExtensibility for business logic\nInitially, having a flow easy to understand by non-developers\nFuturely, having a flow configurable by non-developers\n\nLet’s dive then on a system architecture that can comprise \nall of these worries.\nThe solution\nSince the beginning the idea of this flow, including the concept \nof how the components and the pipeline should work, seemed to us \nlike a good application for a Finite State Machine, \nand that was a POC we would like to test.\nFirst of all we defined as an application the fact that a given \ncompany or person would like to use one of EBANX’s products and \ntherefore would have to be evaluated by the Compliance Team \nauxiliated by our solution.\nIn a finite state machine the state of the processing is kept \non the concept of a state, where this state can be as simple \nas an integer or string field in a struct representing that \napplication. Progress in the processing of that application \nwould be signaled by a signal or input that together with the\ncurrent state would define the next state for that application.\nAnd a simple table would be capable of describing the whole \nflow of providers an application of a given type would pass by.\nBut we wanted to try something even simpler. Not that these \nconcepts would be hard to explain to another programmer, but \nthere was no need not to try and make things even simpler \ngiven our team’s multi area coordination challenges.\nWe have since then a degenerated state machine. There is no concept of signal or input, a single mutate(application_id, current_state, next_state) function is exposed to the components as a way of changing state and denoting progress. This is the minimal concept we got as a way of coordinating our work. And of course, we kept that idea of a nice looking table to demonstrate our flow.\npipelines['product_pipeline_1'] = OrderedDict([\n   ('000_PIPELINE_START', mutate_step('000_PIPELINE_START', '000_COMPONENT_1')),\n   ('000_COMPONENT_1', Component1.process),\n   ('999_COMPONENT_1', mutate_step('999_COMPONENT_1', '000_COMPONENT_2')),\n   ('000_COMPONENT_2', Component2.process),\n   ('999_COMPONENT_2', mutate_step('999_COMPONENT_1', '999_PIPELINE_END')),\n])\n\nLet’s walk through some other concepts here. There are components in the software that are not related to any integration with compliance providers, they are responsible for receiving applications through an API or collecting them from the CRM systems used throughout EBANX. These components will register these applications in the initial state 000_PIPELINE_START.\nFrom that point on the system needs someone to call a /mutate endpoint that will gather all applications that are in one of the states known by the state machine, and apply on them the defined function. Perceive also that there is a mutate_step function that simply mutates things from one state to another giving progress to the pipeline.\nLet’s expand on this point for a bit to explain something. You may ask yourself: “So, do you want to roll out a system that depends on a cron to work?” Well, maybe. At first, for communication with the external world our system uses AWS SNS. An AWS Lambda can be plugged on the SNS to call /mutate on every notification of state change providing a feedback to the state machine and a faster processing flow to the system. Without sacrificing our structure and giving us plenty of space for maneuvering on how we want the system to work and when we want it to work.\nBut back to the pipeline components: every pipeline component has at least two states. A 000_start and a 999_done symbolizing that one application is ready to be processed by that component, and that the component has done the job it should, respectively. It can, and should have more if that fits it’s inner workings, but that is completely up to whoever is designing that component.\nIf a component depends on an asynchronous response from the component that would work like this:\n\nThe code that send the request mutates to a state unknown \n(and by consequence, not managed) by the FSM\nThe endpoint that receives this response should mutate \nback to a state inside the pipeline\n\nBut there are advantages to working with APIs that allow a \npooled approach. Something like the following would be preferable:\n\nThe function handling the 000 state sends a \ncreation request, and mutates to a 100 state\nThe function that handles the 100 state requests \nthe result. If it is pending stays on 100 for a future \nretry, if not moves on to 999\n\nThe point is that this structure is generic enough for \nanything we have tried so far. It would not be difficult \nto convert this into a fully featured finite state machine \nwhere the components use a signal API instead of calling \nmutate directly. But that adds little value to us. Surely \nthe mutate function gives to the component too much power \nallowing it to change the state indiscriminately, but we \nsolved this internally with a simple whitelist on what state \nchanges would be allowed and keeping track of this policy \nwith code review.\nWe may still see downsides on all of this, but so far \nit has worked and has been more of a tool than a nuisance \nfor us.\n","id":"https://jomaro.github.io/blog/minimal-code-pipelines-at-ebanx/","title":"Minimal code pipelines at EBANX"}},"docInfo":{"https://jomaro.github.io/":{"body":15,"title":0},"https://jomaro.github.io/about/":{"body":97,"title":0},"https://jomaro.github.io/blog/":{"body":2,"title":2},"https://jomaro.github.io/blog/a-parallel-quest-in-elixir/":{"body":1015,"title":3},"https://jomaro.github.io/blog/minimal-code-pipelines-at-ebanx/":{"body":603,"title":4}},"length":5},"lang":"English"};
